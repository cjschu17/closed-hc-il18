**Introduction to the Problem**

Multiformity in the Iliad -- We know that there is multiformity in the scholia, but it's scattered throughout different scholia types.  It's also embedded with other quotes, and requires closer analysis.

There is no way to extract the multiforms from Erbse or Dindorf

Reflects the status of the canonical text of the poems during the later Hellenistic period.  It's akin to an Alexandrian app crit for the later Hellenistic period. **should we include the graphic here as well?**

___

**Broader Questions of Text Reuse**

-Text reuse refers to the meaningful reiteration of text.  Sources for text reuse include both extant and lost works, the occasional paraphrase, and hypothetical uses of language. 
___

**Process**

- We systematically extracted all of the non-cited q's in our edition of Iliad 18
- We did a close reading of the Scholia with uncited q's to assign each of them to a subcategory
- Assigned each of them a urn for text reuse analysis
- Subdivided the q's into five categories
	- Quote 1 
	- Quote 2
	- Quote 3
	- Langusage
	- Multiform 1
	- Multiform 2
___
**Specific Examples of Categories**
___
**Quote 1**

Quotation from an extant text.

- 18.38: "ἄλλαι θ', αἳ κατὰ βένθος ἁλὸς Νηρηΐδες ἦσαν·"

- Quote: "ἄλλαι δ' αἳ κατα βένθος ἁλὸς Νηρηϊδες ἦσαν"

___
**Quote 2**

Quotation from an actual text that is no longer extant.

- 18.521:"ἐν ποταμῷ. ὅθι τ' ᾱρδμὸς ἔην πάντεσσι βοτοῖσιν."

- Quote: "'πισσοκονίας ἀρὴν' Κρατῖνος"
___
**Quote 3**

Quotation of hypothetical speech or text 'contrafactual quotation'

- Quote: "οὐδέ τι οἶδε νοῆσαι ἅμα πρόσσω καὶ οπίσσω"

- 18.250: Πανθοίδης. ὃ γὰρ οἶος ὅρα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω· 
___
**Language Usage**

Example of usage quoted from a native speaker's knowledge of the language, not necessarily from a textual example

- Quote: "'τρυφερὰ' 'νήπια' 'πρᾶα' κατ επικράτησιν δὲ τοῦ ἄρρενος εἴρηκε φρονέοντες εἰπὼν καὶ οὐ φρονέουσαι:"

- 18.567: "παρθενικαὶ δὲ καὶ ἠΐθεοι "ἀταλὰ" φρονέοντες."

___

**Multiform 1**

- *still needs formating fixes*

- Direct quotation of a multiform for a given passage

- Can be scanned

Quote: "Ἕκτωρ τὲ Πριάμοιοσὺῒ ΐκελος ἀλκὴνἀλκήν, / ὅς μιν τρὶς μετόπισθε ποδῶν λάβε καὶ μέγ' ἀϋτει  / ἐλκέμεναι μεμαώς κεφαλὴν δέ ἑ θυμὸς ἀνώγει / πῆξαι ἀνα σκόλοπας οἳ τάμονθ' ἁπαλῆς ἀπο δειρῆς"

18.154-18.158: 

"Ἕκτωρ τὲ Πριάμοιο πάϊς φλογὶ εἴκελος ἀλκήν./ τρὶς μέν μιν μετ' όπισθε ποδῶν λάβε φαίδιμος Ἕκτωρ/ ἑλκέμεναι μεμαὼς. μέγα δὲ Τρώεσσιν ὁμόκλα·/ τρὶς δὲ δύ' Αἴαντες, θοῦριν ἐπιειμένοι ἀλκὴν. / νεκροῦ ἀπεστυφέλιξαν· ὃ δ' ἔμπεδον, ἀλκὶ πεποιθὼς."


___

**Multiform 2**

- Apparent multiform, not explicitly identified as such in the text of the scholion.  
- Lemma of the Scholion does not align with the manuscript text
- Our analysis has not focused on this yet.
___
**Sample Size**

All types of scholia in 18:

617 Lines

399 scholia

217 Main Scholia

78 Intermarginal Scholia

38 Interlinear Interlinear

55 Interior Scholia

10 Exterior Scholia
___

**Numbers of Quotes**

109 Langusage

86 Quote1

5 Quote2

4 Quote3

87 Multiform 1

___
**Graphs et cetera -- still needed**

___
**Results**

- There is a correlation between the occurance of a multiform and references to one of the three Alexandrian grammarians (Aristophanes, Aristarchus, or Zenodotus)
- Multiforms tend to appear more often in conjunction with the Aristarchan critical signs

___

**Avenues for Future Analysis**

- Still need to evaluate the strength of the correlation between multiforms and mentions of the Alexandrian editors
- Broadening the sample size by adding text reuse analyses of other books
- Looking at the lemmata to analyze Multiform 2 -- see above
